## Step 1. 
### Good learning practices
Before you start check out this [video](http://www.learningscientists.org/videos/) and/or this [article](https://www.cultofpedagogy.com/learning-strategies/) about good learning practices.

### HTML5
Read about [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5) 

### CSS:
* [CSS reference](http://cssreference.io/) 
* [MDN - Introduction to CSS layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Introduction)
* [CSS-tricks - CSS Properties](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/)
* [MDN - CSS box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model)

## Step 2.
* In Trello, you are assigned to one of the cards of your fellow students (in the Class11 Week0 HTML/CSS list). Give feedback on the application assignment of your fellow student. Please be critical but most of all give constructive feedback. If there are resources that you used and might be useful, share them.
* revisit you own application assignment and improve it with the feedback and suggestions given by one of your classmates.  


> Don't forget, you can always revisit Khan Academy: [Into to HTML/CSS: Making web pages](https://nl.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css) if you are stuck and need a reminder

## Step 3.
### Assignment:
 * Make your own web resume:
    * One page 
    * Two files: HTML and CSS
    * Include the following:
        * Your personal info (name, place of birth, etc.)
        * A picture
        * A few lines about who you are
        * Education
        * Work experience
    * Include the following:
        * Different types of headings (h1, h2)
        * A list (ul). In this list include the _learning strategies_ you used making your resume. Also include some of the resources/references, this can be documentation/video etc, that where helpful.
        * Another list (ul). In this list you include the most important platforms/resources where you can find all hyf related information.
        * img
        * p
        * Some CSS properties: margin, padding 
        * Make sure that you page looks nice, and that your text is readable
    * upload in a zip
    * BEFORE you hand it in, read the [Style guide](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp) and check your files (you can also use the [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org)).

## Fun to check out:
[Shapes of CSS](https://css-tricks.com/examples/ShapesOfCSS/)

## Last but not least, when you are done with the homework check the learning goals at the top of this document. Go through each of them and check if you understand what is written there. Try formulating them into questions and answer your own questions (for example: Wat does it mean when you say that there is a division of labor between HTML and CSS? Why is there a division of labor between HTML and CSS?). If you need help with this, first ask Google, than ask in Slack.
